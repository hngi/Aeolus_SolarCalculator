    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>We are a team of scientists who believe in the creation and consumption of sustainable energy in a bid to rehabilitate our ecosystem. We have committed ourselves to building software and applications that allow individuals to maximize the use of natural energy sources.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>We aim at equipping every household and individual with the ability to generate and manage their own power supply in a way that rehabilitates our ecosystem and preserves it for the sake of future generations.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Why Solarizr?</h3>
    <p>Solarizr creates a way to measure the exact quantity of power consumed over a specific period of time, giving us the ability to plan our power usage in advance, enabling efficient generation per time and storage.</p>

    <p><i>"Like stars harvesting the magnanimous power of the sun, we can light up our universe without burning it down."</i></p>
