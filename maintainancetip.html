            <p>Gives you that edge to do it yourself.</p>
            <p>Solar panels are incredibly reliable. Most systems have no moving parts, and the lifespan for a solar panel can exceed thirty years. This means that solar panel installation companies routinely offer very long warranties and maintenance packages as part of your system cost. Despite this, some preventative maintenance may go a long way towards the longevity and efficiency of your system, and it’s good to know what to do if there is a problem with any of your panels. Follow these tips for decades of clean electricity and savings on your energy bill.Read more </p>
           <p>Sign up now and continue the maintainance</p>
           <p>Purchase a solar panels cleaning kit. It should contain a liquid soap, a wiper, a small brush and in some cases another brush with a longer handle. In many ways, these items are similar to what you use to clean your car, so if you cannot purchase a cleaning kit that is specifically designed for cleaning solar panels then you can substitute it with your car cleaning equipment instead.</p>
           <p>Mix the soap with water in a bucket. The amount that needs to be mixed should be mentioned on the bottle of liquid soap. Usually it is about the same proportion that you use when cleaning your car.</p>
           <p>Dip the brush into the soap and water mixture and gently rub it over the solar panels. If you have the panels divided into smaller arrangements then you should be able to get the job done with a small handheld brush. However, for larger arrangements it can be difficult to reach the panels in the middle so you will need to use the brush with the longer handle.</p>
           <p>Wipe the solar panels with the wiper while the panels are still wet. At times, the wiper is attached at the back of the brush. It is important that you don't allow the soap to dry on the solar panels since this will block the amount of sunlight that they can absorb and make them inefficient.</p>
